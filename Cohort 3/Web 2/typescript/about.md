# TypeScript

## What is typescript?
### TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
### It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

## Where/How does typescript code run?
### Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 
### Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
### Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript
### When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails. 

### tsc is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript
There are many other famous compilers/transpilers for converting Typescript to Javascript. Some famous ones are - 
esbuild
