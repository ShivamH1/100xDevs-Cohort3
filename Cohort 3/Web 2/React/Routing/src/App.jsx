//Single Page Application
// Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user 
// interacts with the app. This approach allows for a smoother user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications (MPAs),
// where each interaction often requires a full page reload.
// How you do that is by using react-routing:

function App() {
  return (
    <div>App</div>
  )
}

export default App
