import React from 'react'
// **Prop drilling** occurs when you need to pass data from a higher-level component down to a lower-level component that is several 
// layers deep in the component tree. This often leads to the following issues:

// - **Complexity:** You may have to pass props through many intermediate components that donâ€™t use the props themselves, just to get 
// them to the component that needs them.
// - **Maintenance:** It can make the code harder to maintain, as changes in the props structure require updates in multiple components.
